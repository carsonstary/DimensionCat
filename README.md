## What is Dimension Cat?
Dimension Cat is an open-world RPG game surrounding the adventures of Benji and his friends. Although the game's style is cute, your mission can be rather dark. You've been knocked off course in your teleportation across the galaxy and ended up... somewhere unexpected. When you tried to portal back, every attempt seemed to fail. From this point on, you must kill enemies in this new dimension to get back home. Once you've killed enough, you can exchange your points for new technology to attempt your travel back again. On your way though, you meet an interesting new foe.

Join Benji and the various dimensions/enemies awaiting your arrival in Dimension Cat. A neverending journey to find "home".
